I cannot generate actual image files as I can only produce text content. Image files like JPEGs are binary files that require actual image data.

For the profile.jpg file, you would need to:

1. Use an actual photo of Adnan
2. Resize it to appropriate dimensions (recommended: 400x400px or 500x500px for web use)
3. Optimize it for web (compress to reasonable file size while maintaining quality)
4. Save it as profile.jpg in the assets/images/ directory

Alternatively, you could:
- Use a placeholder service like https://via.placeholder.com/400x400
- Use a stock photo from sites like Unsplash or Pexels
- Create an avatar using services like Gravatar
- Generate an avatar using tools like Avataaars or similar

The HTML file is already set up to display this image with proper styling and responsive behavior once you add the actual image file to the specified path.
